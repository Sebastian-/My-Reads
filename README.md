# MyReads Project

This is an interactive bookshelf built with React. Users can search for and keep track of books they are interested in by placing them into categories (i.e. Currently Reading, Want To Read, Read). The static content (HTML, CSS, icons etc.) used in this project were provided as part of the React nanodegree program at Udactiy and can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter).
